a confident young female developer standing in a magical classroom filled with floating lines of glowing CSS code written in the air, 
wearing a cozy robe inspired by wizard uniforms, 
holding a wand that emits soft light forming pixelated shapes and code symbols, 
surrounded by enchanted monitors and floating spellbooks, 
blending technology and sorcery, 
warm color palette (soft greens, muted purples, golden browns), 
pixel art style inspired by retro RPGs, 
down-angle perspective, 
cozy nostalgic atmosphere, 
professional game sprite aesthetic, 
clear and centered composition suitable for eBook cover, 
title space at top, subtle background gradient resembling a digital spell aura, 
highly detailed character silhouette, 
evokes curiosity and learning, 
perfect mix of wizardry and coding magic
